This is the first step in my journey to learn React. It is a simple tic-tac-toe game with buttons to reset the game and undo moves. It uses state to keep a record of moves thus enabling the undo feature.

I tried to organize the project files in a standard way and structure the React project according to best practices in terms of separating components and maintaining clear parent/child component relationships.

## Building and running the game

To build and run the application, open a terminal/shell window in the root directory of the project and execute `npm run start`. The application will be running on `localhost:3000`.
